# Validate whether or not a Linked List is palindrome.
CF 401 Data Structures Whiteboard Challenge
Mock Interviews

## Challenge
- Ask the candidate to write a function to validate whether or not a Linked list is palindrome
- Help the candidate understand the definition of a Palindrome if he/she is unsure of it.
    - A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of nodes which reads the same backward as forward.
- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.
This problem can be solved using different approaches:
    - Using a helper data structure (Array or Linked List) to keep track of the nodes.
        - This method takes O(n) and uses O(n) extra space.
    - Reversing the Linked List, and checking for equality of the reversed part.
