# Reverse a Linked List
CF 401 Data Structures Whiteboard Challenge
Mock Interviews

## Challenge
- Ask the candidate to write a function to reverse a Singly Linked List.
- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.
- Attempt to guide the candidate to an in-place solution (i.e. avoid creating a copy of the Linked List).
This problem can be approached in several ways:
- Iterating over the linked list and storing a reference to a current node, its previous node, and its next node.
    - In every iteration, after the next node is stored, the currentâ€™s node next pointer is pointed at the stored reference to the previous node.
    - This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(1) extra space.
- A recursive solution that reverses the body of the link list before re-connecting the head.
    - This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(n) space on the call stack.
- Creating a copy of the linked list, inserting elements at the head of the new list.
    - This solution takes O(n) time and uses O(n) space.
