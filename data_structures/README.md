## Data Structures

### [Singly Linked-List](./linked-list)

List of values stored in nodes linked to each other in one direction.

A singley linked list is beneficial when creating a to do list. You can remove the items when they are completed without having to alter the entire list. And there is no need to iterate through it from both directions.

#### Constructor:
```python
l = LinkedList(iterable='list')
```
#### Implements the following methods:
- **insert(val):** Add another node to the front of the list.
    - Time complexity: O(1)
- **find(val):** Find the node that has the given value. If present, return True; else return False.
    - Time complexity: O(n)
- **append(val):** Append a node to the end of the linked list.
- **insert_before(val, newVal):** Add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- **insert_after(val, newVal):** Add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
- **kth_from_end(k):** Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list.
- **has_loop()):** Return True if there is a circular reference or loop in the linked list; else return False.
- **len():** Get the size of the LinkedList.
    - Time complexity: O(1)
- **pop():** Remove the first node and return it's value. Raises an IndexError if there are no values to return.
    - Time complexity: O(1)
- **remove(node):** Remove the given node from the LinkedList. Raises a ValueError if the node is not in the list.

<!-- ### Trie Tree

Structure for values in a Trie tree. Stores strings as individual character nodes. Each string starts with a '*' node and ends with a '$' node.

<!-- ## Sorting Algorithms
All sorting algorithms will sort a list of comparable items in ascending order.

Each module can be run from the command line for a synopsis of the efficiency of the algorithm in best, average, and worst case scenarios of varying lengths.
```bash
$ cd data-structures/src/sorting_algorithms
sorting_algorithms $ python (algorithm to run).py
```

### Merge Sort

Halve a list repeatedly into the smallest possible pieces, then sort them. Compare each pair of pieces to each other one element at a time, merging them into a larger, sorted piece. Completed when both halves of the list are merged back together.

### Quick Sort

Partition a list into two pieces repeatedly by selecting a pivot value and rearranging the elements such that all values less than the pivot are before it and those greater are after. Each partition is partitioned until the list is completely sorted.
